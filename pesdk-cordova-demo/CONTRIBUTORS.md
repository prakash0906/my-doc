    PhotoEditor SDK Individual Contributor License Agreement, v1.0

    In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
    Contributions from any person or entity, 9elements GmbH. ("PhotoEditor SDK")
    must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that
    has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license
    terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as
    well as the protection of PhotoEditor SDK; it does not change your rights to
    use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

    If you wish to submit a pull request, please read the terms of this agreement
    and indicate your acceptance of it by adding your name, email, and github account name
    to the bottom of this file. Pull requests submitted without accepting this agreement
    will not be reviewed.

    By adding your information to this file, you accept and agree to the following
    terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to
    PhotoEditor SDK. Except for the license granted herein to PhotoEditor SDK and recipients of
    software distributed by PhotoEditor SDK, You reserve all right, title, and interest
    in and to Your Contributions.

    1. Definitions.

    "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
    authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with
    PhotoEditor SDK.

    For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other
    entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
    with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

    For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power,
    direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
    whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
    (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership
    of such entity.

    â€œContribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including
    any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is
    intentionally submitted by You to PhotoEditor SDK for inclusion in, or
    documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by PhotoEditor SDK
    (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any
    form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to PhotoEditor SDK
    or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on
    electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
    tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, PhotoEditor SDK for
    the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
    communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
    writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

    2. Grant of Copyright License.

    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant
    to PhotoEditor SDK and to recipients of software distributed by PhotoEditor SDK
    a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
    Contributions and such derivative works.

    3. Grant of Patent License.

    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant
    to PhotoEditor SDK and to recipients of software distributed by PhotoEditor SDK
    a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made, use, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You
    that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by
    combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
    Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent
    litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or
    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work
    to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
    infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this
    Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date
    such litigation is filed.

    4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
    license.

    If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create
    that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received
    permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your
    employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to PhotoEditor SDK,
    or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with PhotoEditor SDK.

    5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
    creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).

    You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete
    details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but
    not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are
    personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
    Contributions.

    6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
    except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
    support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
    applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions
    on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
    either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
    or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

    7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
    You may submit it to PhotoEditor SDK separately from any Contribution,
    identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or
    other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents,
    trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware,
    and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a
    third-party: [named here]".

    8. You agree to notify PhotoEditor SDK of any facts or circumstances of
    which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate
    in any respect.
